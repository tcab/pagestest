testing github pages

hi there.

see also the `hello.yml` file in .github/workflows which apparently spins up ubuntu and then runs some commands - every time you push?

Interesting, so when you have the 'github pages' set to main master, it just uses your normal `README.md` as its content.

So what if we add an `index.md` ?
